\chapter{The Sessions}

Here is the list of significant sessions covered by this book. The
campaign starts with a bankroll of \$5,000; the ``Bank'' column shows
the resulting bankroll after each session.

I will write about each session later in the book; you may want to
refer back to this table regularly. A quick note on Session 11 (PSH4): I had
a ``\$100 off the \$250 entry fee'' ticket from having done well in
their previous big \$250 game; so although I busted out early the \$250
game only did \$150 damage to the Bank.

I will slice and dice the table above to present the information in
many different ways; I will keep the same reference for each
session. The table above is ordered by date; from earliest to latest.

You can see the fortnightly Thursday Petersham \$250 PLO Sit and Gos
on the calendar. My Canberra trips are either for Friday night or
Saturday night, sometimes both. PLO doesn't always get up on other
nights and I've got business in Sydney on Mondays and Thursdays so
Friday and Saturday nights are easily the best for Canberra PLO. The
MCN1 and PSH4 sessions were one off events, I don't typically play
poker on Mondays. The Lakes Hotel game is Sunday night only.
