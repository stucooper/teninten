\chapter{Professional Poker}

Are you a poker professional? If you've got no other major income and
you're making money primarily through poker, then you're a
professional. For the Spring Campaign of 2019, I was a poker
professional. This chapter covers aspects of playing poker as a pro.

\section*{Keep your expenses down}

You don't want to go through life as a tightwad but you don't want to
go wasting your money either. It's a fine line. One thing I always do
that saves me \$40 or so is book my Sydney Airport Carparking at the
cheaper P3 carpark that's a ten minute walk away from the
terminal. In effect I pay myself \$2 a minute for a 10 minute walk
each way. It's nice to get paid for walking. My trip to Crown ended up
being expensive nonetheless because it was a rushed trip for Cherry
that wasn't booked until the day before I had to fly; that was quite
annoying and my Crown winnings of a bit under \$900 didn't cover the
cost of the trip, but any winnings are good winnings. I'll be going to
Crown in the second week of November, and booking my flights and
parking well in advance.

Canberra trips incur expenses of petrol and often one night's hotel,
but a tank of petrol for my car is about \$70 and a night's hotel at
a very good hotel can be under \$150. Since I've been winning about
\$2,000 at each Canberra session, the expenses are about 10\% of
the win.

I'm no expert on hotels but I will say that if you stay at the Deco
Hotel in Northboure Avenue, you will not be disappointed. You can stay
right next to the casino at the Crowne Plaza Hotel for about the same
price, but since Canberra Casino has a fixed start and finish time,
the convenience of having your room a five minute walk from the casino
isn't as useful as it might otherwise be.

\section*{Game selection}

I didn't play very often in this campaign, sixteen sessions in ten
weeks which doesn't even work out to twice a week. Obviously the
Petersham 250 Sit and Go is a staple of my calendar now and the
Canberra trips are important when I can fit them in.

There was a big St John's Park \$660 No Limit Holdem Tournament Main
Event at the end of the campaign that I considered playing in, but
passed on. Like Rounders Club, St Johns Park Bowling Club is
a venue that I've never done well at.

The Sunday Night 1/1 PLO Cashie at Lakes Hotel is a game I should have
played more often. I lazily passed on the chance to go on three
occasions during the campaign because I found myself busy on Sunday
afternoons. Lakes is a long drive for me but it's a good game and if
I'm good at PLO Cash then I should be playing as much PLO cash as I
can. There's a smaller PLO tournament (\$55 with \$20 option) at
Petersham every Tuesday night that I've never got around to playing
in; I should probably get to this game a few times.

I used to enjoy a \$44 NLH Tournament in Macquarie Park on Wednesday
or Thursday nights. I've never got within a sniff of the money but it
was at a nice pub and easy for me to get to and get home from. I
didn't play it at all in the Spring Campaign and I can't see myself
going back to it; except for the fact that I've never quite finished
my book ``Winning Pub Poker Tournaments'' and should play in a few
more while I finalise the book. I'll see what my schedule looks like
and maybe play this game twice in my next Campaign but it won't make
the Significant Session threshold.

\section*{The Summer 2019 Campaign}

My summer campaign starts today with a drive to Canberra for the
last four horseraces at Canberra Park Racetrack and Casino Canberra's
big PLO cash game. I've got some weeks off in November so I'll make
at least one more trip to Crown and possibly two. I expect the No
Limit Holdem Tournament scene to quieten down during December as
people go on holidays and the Christmas scene takes hold. For calendar
convenience this campaign lasts from Friday 25th October until Tuesday
31st December. This is a 10 week campaign; I will consider week 1
includes the Friday 25th October and week 10 ends on New Year's Eve.

I'll give myself a bigger budget for this campaign, a bank of
\$8,000. This is my reward for my excellent Spring Campaign. I'd like
to double that money in the campaign, so my win target for the eleven
weeks is \$8,000 at a bit under \$800 a week. I did make \$10,000 in
the Spring Campaign so my target is actually a bit under my Spring
result but I need to move house during the Summer Campaign and poker
can't be as strong a focus as it was during Spring.

I'll probably do up another book after the Summer Campaign; I've very
much enjoyed writing this book. I'm thinking of these reports as the
poker professional's equivalent of Quarterly statements. If I had
shareholders or investors in my poker playing, they'd want to see an
Annual Report and quarterly updates to see that their money was being
well used.
